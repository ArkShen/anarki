Anarki: a publicly modifiable 'wiki-like' fork of PG's and RTM's Arc Lisp (http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html)

The intention is to be extremely permissive in accepting patches. For commit
privileges, just submit your first pull request or ask on http://arclanguage.org/forum.

*Important*: If you are running a HN-like site, using this fork will mess up
your data. Come talk to us first, and be sure to make a backup.

To run, install Racket from http://racket-lang.org, then:

    $ git clone http://github.com/arclanguage/anarki
    $ cd arc
    $ ./arc.sh
    arc> :a
    $

If you run into trouble: http://sites.google.com/site/arclanguagewiki; http://arclanguage.org/forum

To run the HN server: lib/how-to-run-news
